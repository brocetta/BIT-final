# Report Manager

## Project Description

Report Manager is a React SPA designed for HR agencies which want to track the job application status of the candidates from their database.

The application consists of two parts: one which is visible to all users (Interviews Reports) and the other which is visible only to authorized ones (Reports Administration).

### Interviews Reports

This part of the application is read-only. Users have access to the list of rendered cards depicting candidates and are allowed to see more info on the candidate and his/her job applications in form of a list of reports. Each report includes information on the company the candidate applied to, the phase of the job recruiting process, whether the candidate has passed the stage, etc.

### Reports Administration

Upon successful authorization, the user is allowed not only to read, but also to delete from and create new reports in the database. For the purpose of creating new reports, an administration wizzard was implemented. A new report will be sent to the database only if certain conditions are fulfilled (e.g. the candidate has passed the previous stage of the process).

## How to Run the Project

This is primarily a front-end project. It is deployed via Netlify: [LINK]

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
